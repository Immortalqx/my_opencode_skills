name: update-source-map
description: Create or update a structured source map (Markdown + JSON) for any project directory. Use when the user wants to (1) index an unfamiliar workspace before doing work in it, (2) refresh a stale source map after files are added, removed, or renamed, (3) prepare quick navigation context for a multi-turn task that touches many files, or (4) preserve a reusable structured inventory of the project. Auto-detects whether to create a new map or update an existing one based on the presence of `x_temp/SOURCE_MAP.md` or `SOURCE_MAP.md` at the workspace root.

when_to_use: The skill always produces a human-readable Markdown `SOURCE_MAP.md` plus a structured `source_map.json` for programmatic queries, and preserves hand-curated per-file summaries in `curated_summaries.json` across regenerations. Trigger on requests like "build a source map for this project", "update the source map", "create a project index", or any task where Claude is about to do work in a workspace it does not already know well.

# Update Source Map

## Overview

Build (or refresh) a structured index of a project directory. The skill always produces a **Markdown** `SOURCE_MAP.md` (primary, human-readable) and a **JSON** `source_map.json` (programmatic). A hand-curated `curated_summaries.json` is preserved across regenerations so curated per-file knowledge compounds over time.

## When this skill runs

Trigger on requests like:
- "build a source map for this project"
- "update the source map"
- "create a project index"
- any task where Claude is about to do work in a workspace it doesn't already know well

Do **not** trigger for: code refactoring, single-file edits, paper reading, or tasks unrelated to project navigation.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Decide mode (auto-detect)

Run `scripts/detect_existing.py <workspace_root>` to decide between **create** and **update** mode. Detection priority:

1. `<workspace>/x_temp/SOURCE_MAP.md` + `x_temp/source_map.json` → update
2. `<workspace>/SOURCE_MAP.md` + `source_map.json` → update
3. `<workspace>/.claude/source_map.json` → update
4. Otherwise → create

The detection JSON has fields: `mode`, `md_path`, `json_path`, `found_at`. Pass `--force-mode create|update` to override.

If detection returns `partial: true` (only one of the two files exists), warn the user before proceeding.

### Step 2 — Confirm the Run Plan

Before any execution, report the plan:

- Which mode (create / update) and why
- Which workspace to scan
- Where the outputs will go (default: `<workspace>/x_temp/`)
- Any custom exclusions or extensions
- Estimated file count from a quick `find` (to set expectations)

If the user explicitly asked you to build or update the source map, proceed after stating the plan. If the user only asked what would happen, stop after the plan.

### Step 3 — Setup

Create the output directory if it doesn't exist:
```bash
mkdir -p <workspace>/x_temp
```

For update mode with diff support, also keep the previous inventory:
```bash
mv <workspace>/x_temp/file_inventory.jsonl <workspace>/x_temp/file_inventory.prev.jsonl
```
(only if regeneration would otherwise lose it)

### Step 4 — Run the pipeline

Two equivalent options:

**Option A — one-shot CLI** (recommended for simple cases):
```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/regenerate.py" <workspace_root> \
    [--output-dir x_temp] \
    [--force-mode create|update] \
    [--exclude "extra_dir1,extra_dir2"] \
    [--keep-prev-inventory]
```

**Option B — modular** (use when intermediate inspection is useful):
```bash
# 1. Scan
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/scan_workspace.py" <workspace_root> \
    --output <workspace>/x_temp/file_inventory.jsonl \
    [--exclude "..."]

# 2. Build
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_source_map.py" \
    --inventory <workspace>/x_temp/file_inventory.jsonl \
    --md-out <workspace>/x_temp/SOURCE_MAP.md \
    --json-out <workspace>/x_temp/source_map.json \
    --curated-out <workspace>/x_temp/curated_summaries.json \
    --mode create|update \
    [--existing-curated <workspace>/x_temp/curated_summaries.json] \
    [--prev-inventory <workspace>/x_temp/file_inventory.prev.jsonl]
```

### Step 5 — Verify (do not skip)

After building, **always** check the following. Each check has a known failure mode from real past runs:

1. **JSON validity**: `python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('<json_path>'))"` — must succeed
2. **File count consistency**: MD + PDF count in `source_map.json["totals"]` must equal `len(files)` — catches partial writes
3. **No type-mismatch in tables**: spot-check 1 row of the Markdown — `r["type"]` should appear in the type column (known bug: hardcoded "PDF" leaked into MD rows in earlier versions)
4. **No root-file-as-folder bug**: top-level rollup table should only contain real folders, not files at workspace root
5. **Curated summaries not lost**: if update mode, `curated_summaries.json` count should be ≥ previous count minus deleted files
6. **No `notes.assets/` leakage**: `find <workspace>/x_temp -name "*.png" -o -name "*.jpg"` should return nothing
7. **Original files untouched**: `find <workspace> -newer <workspace>/x_temp/SOURCE_MAP.md -type f` should not return anything (or only items inside `x_temp/`)

If any check fails, fix the source (`build_source_map.py`) and re-run. Do not patch the output Markdown by hand.

### Step 6 — Hand off

Tell the user:
- Mode used (create / update)
- Number of files indexed
- Where the artifacts live
- Any diff highlights (in update mode)
- Whether the curated_summaries.json was preserved / extended

Append the standard completion audit block (see "Completion audit" below).

## Quick reference — script purposes

| Script | Purpose | Standalone? |
|---|---|---|
| `detect_existing.py` | Decide create vs update by looking for existing artifacts | Yes (CLI) |
| `scan_workspace.py` | Walk the workspace, emit per-file metadata + H2/H3 for .md | Yes (CLI) |
| `extract_headings.py` | Extract H2/H3 from a single .md file (quick one-off) | Yes (CLI) |
| `build_source_map.py` | Take inventory, build Markdown + JSON + curated | Yes (CLI) |
| `regenerate.py` | One-shot orchestrator: detect → scan → build | Yes (CLI) |

## Reference docs (load on demand)

- `references/format-spec.md` — exact schema of `SOURCE_MAP.md`, `source_map.json`, `curated_summaries.json`. Read when you need to know the output structure precisely.
- `references/create-vs-update.md` — the auto-detection rules, when to force-mode, and how curated summaries survive updates. Read when mode decision is unclear.
- `references/exclusions-default.md` — what's filtered out by default, how to add custom exclusions, and the "no modify" file boundary. Read before scanning an unfamiliar project.

## Boundaries (non-negotiable)

- ❌ Never modify files outside the output directory (default: `<workspace>/x_temp/`)
- ❌ Never read PDF contents — metadata only
- ❌ Never index image assets (`*.assets/`, `*.images/`, etc.)
- ❌ Never touch files with names containing `no modify`, `no-edit`, `readonly`, `do not touch`
- ❌ Never overwrite `curated_summaries.json` entries that were curated by hand
- ❌ Never reformat a regeneration silently — if file count changes, surface the diff to the user

## Completion audit

At the end of every run, append:

```text
Completion audit:
- Mode: create | update
- Files indexed: <N> (MD: <M>, PDF: <P>)
- Outputs: <md_path>, <json_path>, <curated_path>
- Curated summaries preserved: yes (N entries) | no (create mode)
- Diff: <N> added, <M> removed (update mode only)
- Original files touched: no
- All 7 verify checks passed: yes | <failed checks>
```

## Lessons embedded in this skill

The skill encodes mistakes from a prior real-world run on a 43-file / 66MB personal knowledge base:

1. **Type-mismatch bug**: hardcoding "PDF" in a loop over a folder that contains a README.md — fixed by using `r["type"]` everywhere
2. **Root-file-as-folder bug**: top-level rollup loop treated root-level files as if they were subdirectories — fixed by skipping `len(parts) == 1` in `compute_top_rollups`
3. **Double-slash in tree root**: render_tree passed both name and a trailing slash — fixed by single source of truth in `tree_root`
4. **Lost curated knowledge**: if curated summaries were stored in the build script, they were lost on every regeneration — fixed by extracting to `curated_summaries.json`
5. **PDF binary read attempts**: avoid `read_text()` on PDFs; only inspect metadata

When you add new scripts, check the verify checklist in Step 5 for additional bugs to add.
