# my_claude_skills

English | [中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

This repository collects my personal Claude Code skills for reusable research workflows.

Each top-level skill folder keeps its own bilingual README files and contains an installable skill directory with `SKILL.md`. The nested layout is intentional: the outer `<skill>/` folder hosts the repository documentation, and only the inner `<skill>/<skill>/` directory is the actual installable unit.

The `mmx-cli` skill is adapted from the upstream MiniMax CLI skill to match the Claude Code skill spec; the frontmatter is updated while the operational guidance is preserved.

Unless a skill explicitly says otherwise, the intended default behavior in this repo is standalone and single-agent: bundled local scripts, local files, and public web access are fair game; notification hooks, reviewer-agent chains, and hidden cross-skill hooks are not part of the normal path.

## Skills

| Skill | Summary | Typical Use | Installable Directory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`alphaxiv`](./alphaxiv/) | Quick single-paper lookup using public AlphaXiv Markdown first, with full AlphaXiv Markdown and arXiv LaTeX source fallback when needed. No local API key is required. | Explaining one arXiv paper from an ID or URL without running a broad literature survey. | [`alphaxiv/alphaxiv`](./alphaxiv/alphaxiv/) |
| [`arxiv`](./arxiv/) | Search arXiv, fetch metadata for specific arXiv IDs, and download paper PDFs into local paper libraries using the bundled arXiv Atom API helper. | Finding preprints, downloading arXiv PDFs by query or ID, and building local `papers/` or `literature/` collections. | [`arxiv/arxiv`](./arxiv/arxiv/) |
| [`drawio-diagram`](./drawio-diagram/) | Draw.io research-figure workflow that builds an editable draw.io draft, reuses source paper/poster assets when available, exports PNG/SVG/PDF, and runs visual QA on the exported PNG until the QA checklist passes. | Paper figures, posters, slide visuals, and concept diagrams that need an editable draw.io artifact the user can keep refining directly in draw.io. | [`drawio-diagram/drawio-diagram`](./drawio-diagram/drawio-diagram/) |
| [`figure-description`](./figure-description/) | Patent figure processing workflow that identifies components, assigns reference numerals, and generates formal drawing descriptions. | Preparing CN/US/EP patent drawing descriptions and reference numeral indexes from local technical figures. | [`figure-description/figure-description`](./figure-description/figure-description/) |
| [`figure-spec`](./figure-spec/) | Deterministic FigureSpec JSON-to-SVG renderer for editable architecture, workflow, pipeline, audit cascade, and topology diagrams. | Producing precise publication-ready vector diagrams without relying on stochastic image generation. | [`figure-spec/figure-spec`](./figure-spec/figure-spec/) |
| [`formula-derivation`](./formula-derivation/) | Research-formula derivation workflow that clarifies assumptions, finds the invariant object, and separates identities, propositions, approximations, and interpretations. | Turning messy theory notes into an internal derivation note, paper-style theory draft, or blocker report. | [`formula-derivation/formula-derivation`](./formula-derivation/formula-derivation/) |
| [`grant-proposal`](./grant-proposal/) | Structured grant-proposal drafting from research ideas and literature, with support for KAKENHI, NSF, NSFC, ERC, DFG, SNSF, ARC, NWO, and generic formats. | Turning a research direction into a funding application with agency-specific sections, aims, milestones, feasibility, and outputs. | [`grant-proposal/grant-proposal`](./grant-proposal/grant-proposal/) |
| [`help-me-read`](./help-me-read/) | Deep-read a user-provided PDF and produce a story-driven close-read note with page screenshots, figure explanations, background context, and a versioned output file. | When the user wants detailed study notes, a tutor-style breakdown, or a close read of a lecture deck or academic paper. | [`help-me-read/help-me-read`](./help-me-read/help-me-read/) |
| [`mmx-cli`](./mmx-cli/) | Adapted MiniMax CLI skill for using the local `mmx` command to generate text, images, video, speech, and music, perform web search and vision understanding, query quotas, manage files, and export command schemas. | When Claude should operate through a configured local MiniMax CLI, especially with `--dry-run`, `--quiet`, `--output json`, and `--non-interactive` for token-conscious checks. | [`mmx-cli/mmx-cli`](./mmx-cli/mmx-cli/) |
| [`mock-review`](./mock-review/) | Mock peer-review workflow for manuscript authors. It researches venue or journal requirements, inspects manuscript PDFs, studies related literature and experimental baselines, and writes a simulated review for rebuttal preparation and paper improvement. | Pre-submission risk check, rebuttal preparation, reviewer-style critique before revising a manuscript. | [`mock-review/mock-review`](./mock-review/mock-review/) |
| [`novelty-check`](./novelty-check/) | Research-idea novelty checker that extracts core claims, searches recent literature, compares closest prior work, and reports novelty risk. | Checking whether a method has already been done before investing implementation time. | [`novelty-check/novelty-check`](./novelty-check/novelty-check/) |
| [`proof-writer`](./proof-writer/) | Rigorous proof-writing workflow for theorem, lemma, proposition, and corollary statements. It repairs proof sketches, surfaces missing assumptions, and reports blockers when a claim is not justified. | Turning a rough mathematical claim or proof sketch into a defensible proof package. | [`proof-writer/proof-writer`](./proof-writer/proof-writer/) |
| [`research-lit`](./research-lit/) | Standalone literature-review workflow across local PDFs, public web search, and structured arXiv metadata. | Finding related work, mapping a paper landscape, and comparing paper clusters around a research topic. | [`research-lit/research-lit`](./research-lit/research-lit/) |
| [`research-survey-loop`](./research-survey-loop/) | Long-running literature survey workflow. It creates or resumes survey tasks, maintains stable task documents, searches prioritized sources, migrates local PDFs, reads papers in chunks, and incrementally writes a Chinese survey. | Sustained literature surveys for robotics, embodied AI, computer vision, world models, navigation, manipulation, 3D perception, and adjacent topics. | [`research-survey-loop/research-survey-loop`](./research-survey-loop/research-survey-loop/) |
| [`research-wiki`](./research-wiki/) | Persistent project-level research knowledge base for papers, ideas, experiments, claims, and typed relationships. | Building reusable project memory instead of rediscovering the same field map in every session. | [`research-wiki/research-wiki`](./research-wiki/research-wiki/) |
| [`update-source-map`](./update-source-map/) | Create or update an agent-readable source map (Markdown + JSON) for any project directory. It auto-detects whether to build a new map or refresh an existing one, and preserves hand-curated per-file summaries across regenerations. | When starting work in a new / unfamiliar workspace, refreshing a stale index after files change, or handing a project over to another agent. | [`update-source-map/update-source-map`](./update-source-map/update-source-map/) |

## Install

The installable unit of each skill is the nested `<skill>/<skill>/` directory inside this repo. The outer `<skill>/README.md` and `<skill>/README.zh-CN.md` are repository docs only and must not be copied into the Claude skills directory.

Install a single skill:

```bash
cp -r <skill>/<skill>/* ~/.claude/skills/<skill>/
```

Install every skill in one loop:

```bash
for s in alphaxiv arxiv drawio-diagram figure-description figure-spec formula-derivation grant-proposal help-me-read mmx-cli mock-review novelty-check proof-writer research-lit research-survey-loop research-wiki update-source-map; do
  cp -r "$s/$s"/* ~/.claude/skills/"$s"/
done
```

After installation the skills are invokable as `/alphaxiv`, `/arxiv`, etc. Do not install the outer `<skill>/` folder — that would copy the bilingual README files into the installed skill.

## Notes

- These skills encode personal research workflows and do not represent official processes of any venue, journal, or institution.
- All `SKILL.md` frontmatter conforms to the Claude Code skill spec: `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`, and optionally `disable-model-invocation` and `when_to_use`. Bundled scripts are resolved via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` so the same skill works whether installed at `~/.claude/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`.
- `mmx-cli` requires a configured local `mmx` command; use `--dry-run`, `--quiet`, `--output json`, and `--non-interactive` for token-conscious agent checks.
- `drawio-diagram` is intended for editable figure workflows; it produces a `.drawio` plus PNG/SVG/PDF exports and only declares the figure ready after the visual QA loop passes.
- Outputs from `mock-review` should be clearly labeled as simulated/mock reviews. They must not replace real peer review or impersonate official reviewer reports.
- Literature retrieval should prioritize legally accessible sources such as official open-access pages, arXiv, OpenReview, and author pages.
- For details about a specific skill, read the README files inside that skill folder.
