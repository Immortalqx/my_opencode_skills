# alphaxiv

Chinese version: [README.zh-CN.md](./README.zh-CN.md)

`alphaxiv` is a quick single-paper lookup skill for arXiv papers. It uses public AlphaXiv Markdown pages first, then falls back to full AlphaXiv Markdown or arXiv LaTeX source when the question needs more detail.

Use the `alphaxiv` skill when you want Claude to quickly explain one paper from an arXiv ID or URL:

```text
Use the alphaxiv skill to explain https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345 and focus on the method.
```

## Dependency Note

No local API key is required. The skill depends on public access to:

- `https://alphaxiv.org/overview/<paper-id>.md`
- `https://alphaxiv.org/abs/<paper-id>.md`
- `https://arxiv.org/src/<paper-id>`

If AlphaXiv has not processed a paper, the skill falls back to deeper public sources.

## Workflow

1. Extract a clean arXiv paper ID from a bare ID, arXiv URL, PDF URL, or AlphaXiv URL.
2. Fetch the AlphaXiv overview first.
3. Escalate to full AlphaXiv Markdown only when the overview is insufficient.
4. Escalate to arXiv LaTeX source only for equations, proofs, appendix details, or implementation details.
5. Return a concise answer with the source depth used.

## Contents

- `alphaxiv/SKILL.md`: Claude skill definition.
- The outer `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` are repository docs only and are not installed.

## Install

Copy the inner `alphaxiv/` directory flat into the local Claude skills folder:

```bash
cp -r alphaxiv/alphaxiv/* ~/.claude/skills/alphaxiv/
```

The skill is then available as `/alphaxiv`.
