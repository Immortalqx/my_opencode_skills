# proof-writer

English | [中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

`proof-writer` is a Claude Code skill for writing mathematically honest proofs for ML and AI theory. It helps Claude prove theorem, lemma, proposition, and corollary statements, repair proof sketches, identify missing assumptions, or report when a claim is not currently justified.

Use the `proof-writer` skill when you want Claude to turn a rough claim or proof sketch into a rigorous proof package:

```text
Use the proof-writer skill to prove the theorem in appendix_notes.md. If the claim is too strong, weaken it explicitly and write the corrected proof.
```

For a direct prompt:

```text
Use the proof-writer skill to formalize this proof sketch and tell me whether the lemma is provable under the stated assumptions.
```

## Workflow

1. Claude gathers the theorem statement, assumptions, notation, local drafts, and any proof sketch.
2. Claude normalizes the claim without silently changing what must be proved.
3. Claude classifies the claim as provable as stated, provable after weakening or an extra assumption, or not currently justified.
4. Claude writes a structured proof package with assumptions, notation, dependency map, proof, corrections, and open risks.
5. If a key step cannot be justified, Claude reports the blocker instead of fabricating a proof.

## Outputs

- A proof package, usually `PROOF_PACKAGE.md` unless the user specifies another target file.
- A short chat summary of the proof status, whether the original claim survived unchanged, and which file was updated.

## Installable Directory

The installable Claude skill is:

```text
proof-writer/proof-writer/
```

Do not install the outer `proof-writer/` folder. It contains repository README files only.

## Contents

- `proof-writer/SKILL.md`: proof-writing workflow and rigor rules.

## Install

```bash
cp -r proof-writer/proof-writer/* ~/.claude/skills/proof-writer/
```

The skill is then available as `/proof-writer`.
